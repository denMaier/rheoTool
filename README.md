## About

[RheoTool] is an open-source toolbox based on [OpenFOAM®] to simulate Generalized Newtonian Fluids (GNF) and viscoelastic fluids under pressure-driven and/or electrically-driven flows. In addition to continuum mechanics solvers, [RheoTool] also has a Brownian dynamics solver to simulate polymer molecules individually.  

The theory behind the single-phase flow solvers used in [RheoTool] can be found in [Pimenta F. and Alves M.A., 2017, J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnnfm.2016.12.002) for pressure-driven flows, in [Pimenta F. and Alves M.A., 2018, arXiv:1802.02843](http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02843) for electrically-driven flows, in [Pimenta F. and Alves M.A., 2020, arXiv:2004.14235](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14235) for non-isothermal flows with conjugate heat transfer and in *TBA* for film-casting simulations. The Brownian dynamics solver was presented in [Pimenta F. et al., 2018, Biomicrofluidics](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5037472).

Since version 4.0, [RheoTool] includes interfaces to the sparse matrix solvers of three external libraries: [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/), [Hypre](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/hypre-scalable-linear-solvers-multigrid-methods) and [PETSc](https://petsc.org/release/). Both coupled and segregated solution methods have been implemented, as described in [Pimenta F. and Alves M.A., 2019, Computer & Fluids](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compfluid.2019.104279).

The library containing the viscoelastic fluid models has been developed based on the library used by _viscoelasticFluidFoam_ [(Favero et al., 2010, J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech.)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnnfm.2010.08.010), already present in [foam-extend 4.0]. 
 

## Features

* all the features are available for 2D/3D problems and generic grids;
* the code for continuum mechanics is fully-parallelized with MPI;
* all solvers support either moving or static meshes;
* non-isothermal flows, including conjugate heat transfer in multi-regions; 
* wide range of electrically-driven flow models;
* wide range of rheological models (viscoelastic, thixotropic elasto-viscoplastic and GNF);
* the log-conformation tensor approach is available for all viscoelastic models; 
* the transient flow solvers (_rheoFoam_ and _rheoEFoam_) are highly stable regarding pressure-stress-velocity coupling;
* the material functions of any rheological model can be obtained numerically (_rheoTestFoam_);
* wide range of (direct/iterative) sparse matrix solvers available through the interfaces to external libraries;
* segregated and coupled solvers;
* Brownian dynamics solver implementing bead-spring models; 
* solver based on a 2.5D model to simulate film-casting (_rheoFilmFoam_);
* a set of tutorials is included to illustrate the application of the solvers to different problems;
* the theory and the tutorials are described in a user-guide;
* a solver for two-phase flows is available (_rheoInterFoam_), where any GNF or viscoelastic model can be used for each phase (_under-development_);
* the tool is available for both [OpenFOAM®] and [foam-extend] versions.
