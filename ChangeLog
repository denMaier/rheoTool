Version 6.0

Released on 03/07/2022.

o Generic:
	
	- Add: added rheoTool version for OpenFOAM(R) v9.0. The version compatible with OpenFOAM(R) v7.0 will be discontinued in a future release.
	
    - Fix: the code version for OpenFOAM(R) v9.0 is now compatible with Clang/llvm (tested on Clang/llvm 12).
	
	- Change: upgrade to Petsc v3.16.5 (of90), but retains back-compatibility with older versions.
	 
o Solvers:
	
	- Add: added solver rheoFilmFoam for the simulation of film-casting according to a 2.5D approach. 
	
o Constitutive equations:
	
	- Add: added the sPTT-IKH thixo-elastoviscoplastic model.
	
	- Fix: re-implemented etaSThermo() to avoid error in models that do not re-define it. Added member function hasThermo() in the base to distinguish thermo-enabled models.
	
o Boundary conditions:
	
	- Add: added BC poiseuilleVelocity, which defines the analytical velocity profile for laminar flows across cross-sections of rectangular (3D/2D) and circular shapes. 
	

o Multiphase:
	
	- Fix: the two-phase flow solver rheoInterFoam was re-implemented on the top of interFoam. It now shares the same controls for PIMPLE (with the extra-feature of supporting SIMPLEC) and inherits the phase-change model of interFoam. However, this solver keeps untested and under-development. Use it on your own risk.   
	

//************************************************************\\

Version 5.0

Released on 30/04/2020.

o Generic

	- Add: added rheoTool version for OpenFOAM v7.0. The version compatible with OpenFOAM v6.0 will be discontinued in a future release.

	- Change: the rheoTool version compatible with foam-extend is no longer updated. The last updated version is rheoTool v4.1.

o Non-isothermal solvers
	
	- Add: solver rheoHeatFoam is now available to solve for non-isothermal flows. The corresponding tutorials and theory in the user-guide are also available.
	
	- Add: solver rheoMultiRegionFoam is now available to solve for non-isothermal flows in multi-region domains with explicit/implicit coupling of
	  the energy equation between regions. The corresponding tutorials and theory in the user-guide are also available.

o Coupled solvers

	- Fix: fixed bug related with ddt-phi correction for coupled solvers.
	
	- Change: the library containing the machinery for coupled solvers has been (significantly) modified in order to handle multi-region domains in a single coupled matrix.

o Sparse matrix solvers

	- Add: added support for cyclicAMI patches in coupled and segregated solvers. However, cyclicAMI patches of rotational type are only partially supported
	 (explicitly handled in segregated solvers and not available in coupled solvers).

o Multiphase

	- Fix: improved consistency of SIMPLEC algorithm in the two-phase flow solver (rheoInterFoam).

//************************************************************\\

Version 4.1

Released on 17/06/2019.

o Sparse matrix solvers:
	
	- Fix:fixed two memory leaks in class coupledSolver, one minor (argv for PETSc) and one major (related with matrix A0). Only for the OpenFOAM version.
	
	- Change: changed the options file of several classes and applications to be more generic regarding the MPI implementation (it will now automatically
      share the one used by OpenFOAM, defined in $WM_MPLIB). Only for the OpenFOAM version.

	Note: running PETSc with OpenMPI seems to generate a small memory leak in function PetscInitialize(). This leak is of small importance, but can
	be avoided under other MPI implementations (e.g. MPICH).

o Constitutive equations

	- Add and change: the class for the PTT constitutive equation was modified to incorporate all variants of this model in a single class. Therefore, the
	  previous PTTexp and PTTlinear classes are now variants of a single class named PTT, whose typename is also PTT. In addition to the linear and
	  exponential variants of the model, a third one, denoted generalized, was added based on Ref. [27]. The selection between variants relies on keyword
	  destructionFunctionType (see the tutorials). All the changes/additions are for both stress-tensor and log-conformation tensor approaches. See Table 4.1.

o Electrically-driven flows

	- Fix: fixed a bug in model NernstPlanckCoupled which was leading to spurious simulation aborts in some cases. Only for the OpenFOAM version.

o Tutorials

	- Change: all tutorials involving the PTT constitutive equation were modified according to the new syntax of this model, arising from code reorganization.

//************************************************************\\

Version 4.0

Released on 04/04/2019.

o Generic:

	- Add: added interfaces to PETSc, Hypre and Eigen libraries, allowing the use of their (direct and iterative) sparse matrix solvers.
		   All the interfaces can be used in parallel, except the one for Eigen. Only for the OpenFOAM version.
	
	- Add: rheoTool needs PETSc as an extra dependency. Added a script to install this package. The instructions to install rheoTool have
		   been updated (see Chapter 2). Only for the OpenFOAM version.
	
	- Add: added coupled solvers for both pressure- and electrically-driven flows. Most viscoelastic models can be solved within a coupled
		   solution method. Only for the OpenFOAM version.
	
	- Change: rheoTool version compatible with OpenFOAM v4.0/4.1 is discontinued.

o Electrically-driven flows:

	- Add: added coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck model to EDF models (TypeName = NernstPlanckCoupled). Only for the OpenFOAM version.

o Constitutive equations:
 
	- Change: the eXtended Pom-Pom model implementation has been changed in order to allow using its thermodynamically consistent version [8].
		      Parameter n has been added (see Table 4.1) and should be adjusted by the user (n = 1 for thermodynamic consistency and n = 0 otherwise).
	
	- Change: the code for the constitutive equations of viscoelastic models has been modified to allow integration with coupled solvers. Only for the
			  OpenFOAM version.

o Solvers:

	- Fix: fixed bug in rheoInterFoam for OpenFOAM version 6.0, which was preventing post-processing (missing call to update()).

o Tutorials:

	- Change: tutorial rheoFoam/Cavity now uses sparse matrix solvers from Eigen library and is 1.6 times faster. Only for the OpenFOAM version.
	
	- Change: tutorial rheoFoam/Cylinder is now solved coupled, being 30 times faster. Only for the OpenFOAM version.

	- Change: tutorial rheoEFoam/ICEO/NernstPlanck is now solved with the coupled implementation of the PNP model and is 30 times faster. The name
			  of the tutorial was changed to rheoEFoam/ICEO/NernstPlanckCoupled. Only for the OpenFOAM version.
	
	- Change: tutorial rheoEFoam/selecMembrane/NernstPlanck/solution1D is now solved with the coupled implementation of the PNP model and is twice
			  faster. Moreover, under-relaxation is not needed anymore to avoid numerical divergence. Only for the OpenFOAM version.
	
	- Fix: fixed bug related to the old flag for stabilization methods in several tutorials, which was aborting the runs.

	- Add: the (single-equation) eXtended Pom-Pom viscoelastic model has been added to the library of constitutive equations. Both the stress and log-conformation versions are available.   
	
	- Change: sPTT models have been generalized to their full form by replacing the upper-convected derivative by the Gordon-Schowalter derivative. It is now possible to simulate PTT models with non-affine deformation, in both the stress and log-conformation versions.
	
	- Change: the stabilization method in viscoelastic simulations has been made general and run time selectable: none, BSD or coupling.
	
	- Change: a verification step has been added to the WhiteMetznerLog model in order to prevent its incorrect use (see note in the user-guide table with the constitutive equations).  
	
o Post-Processing:
	
	- Add: class ppUtil for post-processing purposes has been added to the versions for OpenFOAM and the one existing for foam-extend has been modified. Enable the use of multiple ppUtil in simultaneous.
	
	- Fix: sampling error was fixed for the tutorials of versions of40 and fe40.
	
o Multiphase flows:
	
	- Change: (fvc::grad(U) & fvc::grad(etaS()*alpha)) has been replaced by fvc::div(etaS()*alpha*dev2(T(fvc::grad(U)))) for the use in multiphase flows (constitutiveEq.C).
	
	- Fix: call to constrainPressure() in reoInterFoam, version of40, has been corrected for the SIMPLEC algorithm (pEqn.H). Added a section in the user-guide on how to use properly the fixedFluxPressure BC with reoInterFoam in versions of222 and fe40. 
	
	- Add: tutorials on the die swell problem.
	
o Generic: 
	
	- Fix: code clean-up and bug fix in BC evaluation of the explicit fvc::div(phi,X) operator in class GaussDefCmpw.
	 
	- Change/Add: replace boundary condition extST by the Type-independent linearExtrapolation boundary condition (no backward compatibility). Added optional second-order regression.
	
	- Change: major update of the user guide to include electrically-driven flows. Other changes were made in its content and organization, and some typos were corrected.
